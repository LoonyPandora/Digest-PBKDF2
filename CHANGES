1.0.0   2012-04-04

    [ DOCUMENTATION ]
    * Added example usage to all methods
        (James Aitken)

    [ FEATURE ]
    * The digest method now matches other Digest:: namespace modules,
      and only returns the digest.
      
      This means specifing the encoding when creating a new Digest::PBKDF2
      object is no longer necessary or supported.
      
      To access the different encodings, one should use the new as_ldap
      and as_crypt methods
      
      This is a backwards incompatible change.
        (James Aitken)

    * Added as_ldap and as_crypt methods to mitigate the changing of the
      digest method to only return the digest
        (James Aitken)
          
    * Added salt method to specify the salt directly, rather than parsing
      it from the data that was added, simplifying the interface. You must
      explicitly set the empty string to create a salt-less hash.
      
      The salt method acts as a getter to read the salt as currently set
        (James Aitken)

    [ BUGFIX ]
    * hexdigest and b64digest now correctly return the encoded version of the digest
        (James Aitken)

    [ TESTS ]
    * Updated tests and split into multiple test files for readability
        (James Aitken)
